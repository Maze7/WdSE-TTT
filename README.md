# WdSE-TTT
TicTacToe for university exam in "Tools of Software Engeering". 
The goal is to write a reasonably good styled and testable code. There is no aim on performance or completeness.

This project should integrated in a self hosted build toolchain consisting of Subversion and Jenkins. 

*The code of TicTacToe is very overbloated. It is intended to be only exemplary code for this specific continuous integration (test-)setup.*

# Why?
Maybe this repository is helpful for future groups of the same module.

*For reference: It is the third task in "Praktikum: Werkzeuge des Software Engeneering".* 

# Setup
You can use the (ugly) setup scripts if you want to run svn and jenkins inside a freshly installed Ubuntu server.
```
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/Maze7/WdSE-TTT/
cd WdSE-TTT

sudo bash setup-svn.sh
```
